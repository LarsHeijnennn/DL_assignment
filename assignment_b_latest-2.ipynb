    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines six variations of a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture in PyTorch, designed for multi-class classification (default: 5 classes, such as accent or gender prediction from spectrograms). Each model uses three convolutional layers, a global pooling layer to standardize feature map sizes, and a fully connected (linear) output layer. The variations explore the effects of batch normalization and dropout regularization on training stability and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shared Core Design (all models):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convolutional Layers (`Conv2d`):**  \n",
    "  Three stacked 2D convolutional layers with increasing channel depth (8 → 16 → 32), kernel size 3×3, and padding to keep feature map sizes consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Activation (`ReLU`):**  \n",
    "  Each convolution is followed by a ReLU activation for non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pooling (`AdaptiveAvgPool2d`):**  \n",
    "  Shrinks feature maps to a fixed 16×16 size, allowing input spectrograms of varying dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flattening:**  \n",
    "  The pooled output is flattened to a 1D vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fully Connected Layer (`Linear`):**  \n",
    "  Maps extracted features to the desired number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CNNBaseline**  \n",
    "   The simplest model: just convolutions, activations, pooling, and a final linear layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CNNBaseline_BatchNorm**  \n",
    "   Adds batch normalization after each convolution (not after activation in the code), which stabilizes and speeds up training by normalizing layer inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CNNBaseline_Dropout3**  \n",
    "   Adds a dropout layer (dropout probability 0.3) before the final linear layer to randomly zero some activations during training, helping prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CNNBaseline_Dropout5**  \n",
    "   Same as above but with a higher dropout rate (0.5) for stronger regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CNNBaseline_Dropout3_BatchNorm**  \n",
    "   Combines both batch normalization after each convolution and dropout (0.3) before the final layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **CNNBaseline_Dropout5_BatchNorm**  \n",
    "   Combines batch normalization with a higher dropout rate (0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward Pass Flow (for all models)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:**  \n",
    "   Receives a batch of spectrograms (e.g., `[B, 1, F, T]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conv → ReLU → [BatchNorm]:**  \n",
    "   Processes input through three convolutional layers with ReLU activations; some models also normalize with batch normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pooling:**  \n",
    "   Reduces output to a fixed 16×16 feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dropout (if included):**  \n",
    "   Applies dropout regularization before classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Flatten and Classify:**  \n",
    "   Flattens the pooled feature map and passes it to the fully connected layer for prediction.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why so many models?\n",

    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines six variations of a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture in PyTorch, designed for multi-class classification (default: 5 classes, such as accent or gender prediction from spectrograms). Each model uses three convolutional layers, a global pooling layer to standardize feature map sizes, and a fully connected (linear) output layer. The variations explore the effects of batch normalization and dropout regularization on training stability and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shared Core Design (all models):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convolutional Layers (`Conv2d`):**  \n",
    "  Three stacked 2D convolutional layers with increasing channel depth (8 → 16 → 32), kernel size 3×3, and padding to keep feature map sizes consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Activation (`ReLU`):**  \n",
    "  Each convolution is followed by a ReLU activation for non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pooling (`AdaptiveAvgPool2d`):**  \n",
    "  Shrinks feature maps to a fixed 16×16 size, allowing input spectrograms of varying dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flattening:**  \n",
    "  The pooled output is flattened to a 1D vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fully Connected Layer (`Linear`):**  \n",
    "  Maps extracted features to the desired number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CNNBaseline**  \n",
    "   The simplest model: just convolutions, activations, pooling, and a final linear layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CNNBaseline_BatchNorm**  \n",
    "   Adds batch normalization after each convolution (not after activation in the code), which stabilizes and speeds up training by normalizing layer inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CNNBaseline_Dropout3**  \n",
    "   Adds a dropout layer (dropout probability 0.3) before the final linear layer to randomly zero some activations during training, helping prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CNNBaseline_Dropout5**  \n",
    "   Same as above but with a higher dropout rate (0.5) for stronger regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CNNBaseline_Dropout3_BatchNorm**  \n",
    "   Combines both batch normalization after each convolution and dropout (0.3) before the final layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **CNNBaseline_Dropout5_BatchNorm**  \n",
    "   Combines batch normalization with a higher dropout rate (0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward Pass Flow (for all models)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:**  \n",
    "   Receives a batch of spectrograms (e.g., `[B, 1, F, T]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conv → ReLU → [BatchNorm]:**  \n",
    "   Processes input through three convolutional layers with ReLU activations; some models also normalize with batch normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pooling:**  \n",
    "   Reduces output to a fixed 16×16 feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dropout (if included):**  \n",
    "   Applies dropout regularization before classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Flatten and Classify:**  \n",
    "   Flattens the pooled feature map and passes it to the fully connected layer for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why so many models?\n",
