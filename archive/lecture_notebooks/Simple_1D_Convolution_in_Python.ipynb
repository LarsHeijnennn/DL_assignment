    "# Implementing a 1D CNN\n",
    "This Notebook serves as a beginner-friendly guide to understanding and implementing a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python. The notebook breaks down the key components of CNNs, including convolution, ReLU activation, and pooling, into separate functions. You are encouraged to complete these functions step by step, gaining practical experience in building neural network layers, and link theory and practice. \n",
    "The ideas behind this implementation applies to all kinds of convolution (1D, 2D, 3D), but we stick to 1D for simplicity of the code."

    "## Convolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `apply_convolution` function is designed to perform convolution on a 1D input (with possibly many channels) using a set of given filters. Convolution is a fundamental operation in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where filters are applied to input data to extract features. The purpose of this function is to provide hands-on experience in implementing the convolution operation supporting a variable stride.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters:\n",
    "- **input_data:** A numpy array representing the input data. It is expected to be 2D array with dimensions (num channels, input length).\n",
    "- **filters:** A list of 2D numpy arrays representing the filters.\n",
    "- **stride:** An integer indicating the step size or stride of the convolution operation. The default value is 1, meaning the filters move one element at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns:\n",
    "- **output:** A 3D numpy array representing the result of the convolution. The dimensions of the output are determined by the number of filters and the length of the resulting convolved sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Logic:\n",
    "1. The function begins by ensuring that the input data and filters have compatible dimensions. The input data must be either 1D (in case the input has only one chanel) or 2D, and the filters must be 2D.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An empty array (`output`) is initialized to store the convolution result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The function calculates the length of the output based on the input data, filter dimensions, and the specified stride.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A loop iterates through the input data, applying convolution with the specified stride. The result is computed using element-wise multiplication between the filter and the corresponding portion of the input data, followed by summation along both axes (e.g., axis=(1, 2)).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The final output is a 2D numpy array representing the convolution result.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to complete the function by implementing the convolution operation with the given filters and handling the input data. You should pay attention to the stride parameter, ensuring that the filters move with the specified step size. The completed function will be a crucial building block for creating a convolutional layer in a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simpler variation:**\n",
    "You can build a simpler approach first by ignoring the stride and assuming it is always 1."
